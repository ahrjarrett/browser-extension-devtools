Load extension from the ~build~ folder (might have to run watch first).

Manifest in ~public~ directory has correct shape for extension, and is where you can configure your app.

Built with CRA without ejecting, which is still feasible

* Instructions

Do ~npm run watch~ to live reload your changes.

On any webpage:
1. Open the extension popup from the extensions bar
1. Right click and do 'Inspect' (so extension doesn't close btwn loads)
1. Right click again and open 'Open Remote DevTools '
1. The best way I've found to refresh is to open the DevTools you opened and hit Cmd/Ctrl+R (there is probably an option that forces refresh for you, but haven't read all those docs yet)
